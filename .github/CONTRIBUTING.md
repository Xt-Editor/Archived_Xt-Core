# Hacking on Xt

(This is derived from Limetext's templates. Kudos to them.)

1. The issues list is for development purposes only.
   All issues reported in this repository should result in **code
   being changed, added, or removed**.

* Issues should be opened in the *correct* repository.
  Issue should only be reported here if they cover the `xt/core`
  project. Other issues that pertain to another aspect of the Xt
  project should be reported in that repository.

## Code contributions

### Branch naming conventions

Feature branches should be named according to this template:
`feature/{FEATURE_NAME}`

Bugfix branches should be named according to this template:
`bugfix/{ISSUE_ID}`

### Commit messages

When committing to Xt, and its subprojects, **please** commit
using the style advocated [here][beamsgit]. People who make commits
that blindingly violate these principles will be asked politely to
change the commit message, if possible. However, exceptions can be
made on a case-by-case basis.
