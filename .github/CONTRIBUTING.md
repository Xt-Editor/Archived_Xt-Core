### Branch naming conventions

Feature branches should be named according to this template:

### Commit messages

When committing to Xtensis, and its subprojects, **please** commit
using the style advocated [here][beamsgit]. People who make commits
that blindingly violate these principles will be asked politely to
change the commit message, if possible. However, Exceptions can be
made on a case-by-case basis.
