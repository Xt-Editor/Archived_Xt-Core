# The Xt Project: Xt Core

This is the repository for the Xt Core subsystem, which is the "heart"
of the Xt Editor. Without the core, Xt is useless!

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to Xt, and/or the projects that are a part
of it, feel free to contact me on IRC, and we can discuss ideas.

The IRC channel can be found on Mozilla IRC, on `#xt-editor`

[xt-install]: /INSTALL.md
